# The Impact of Branding on Coffee Taste Perception
### Overview
Branding plays a critical role in how consumers perceive and evaluate everyday products — including coffee. While packaging and brand identity can influence buyer behavior, we ask a more specific question:

Does branding actually affect how a coffee tastes to a consumer?

This project explores whether seeing the brand label of a coffee changes participants’ perceived taste satisfaction. Using a randomized field experiment, we compare taste scores for branded versus non-branded coffee samples.

### Research Question
Does the presence of coffee branding impact consumers' perceived taste satisfaction?

### Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis (H₀): Branding has no effect on taste satisfaction scores.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Branding has an effect on taste satisfaction scores.

We predict that branded samples — especially from a premium brand — may lead to higher taste satisfaction scores due to brand loyalty, recognition, and packaging aesthetics.

### Experimental Design
**Design Type:** Between-subjects field experiment  
**Sample Size:** Friends, colleagues, and family members    
**Treatment:** Coffee samples labeled with brand names  
**Control:** Coffee samples labeled generically   
**Brands Tested:**
